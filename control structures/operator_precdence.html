    JavaScript operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated when an expression is evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first, and those with lower precedence are evaluated later.

Here is a list of JavaScript operator precedence, in order from highest to lowest:

    Grouping: ()
    Member access: ., []
    Function call and arguments: ()
    New (with arguments): new
    Unary prefix operators: +, -, !, ~, typeof, void, delete, await
    Exponentiation: **
    Multiplication, division, and remainder: *, /, %
    Addition and subtraction: +, -
    Bitwise shift: <<, >>, >>>
    Relational: <, <=, >, >=, in, instanceof
    Equality: ==, !=, ===, !==
    Bitwise AND: &
    Bitwise XOR: ^
    Bitwise OR: |
    Logical AND: &&
    Logical OR: ||
    Conditional (ternary) operator: ? :
    Assignment: =, +=, -= and so on
    Comma: ,

It's important to be familiar with operator precedence in JavaScript, as it can affect the results of expressions and the behavior of programs.

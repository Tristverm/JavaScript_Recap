    Here are the operators that can be used in JavaScript boolean conditions:

    && (Logical AND): returns true if both operands are true.
    || (Logical OR): returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
    ! (Logical NOT): returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.
    == (Equality): returns true if the operands are equal in value, but not necessarily in type.
    === (Strict Equality): returns true if the operands are equal in value and type.
    != (Inequality): returns true if the operands are not equal in value, but not necessarily in type.
    !== (Strict Inequality): returns true if the operands are not equal in value or type.
    < (Less Than): returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    > (Greater Than): returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    <= (Less Than or Equal To): returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
    >= (Greater Than or Equal To): returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Note: The operands used in boolean conditions can be any value or expression that can be evaluated to true or false, not just boolean literals.

//HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. It allows the client to request resources from the server and receive responses in return. There are four commonly used HTTP request methods:



//GET: This method is used to retrieve data from a server. It is the most common method and is typically used when you want to retrieve information from a specific URL. For example:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json(); // Parsing the response body as JSON
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Accessing the response data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error); // Handling any errors
  });

  //In this example, we make a GET request to the URL 'https://api.example.com/users'. The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to the response object. We then check if the response is successful (response.ok) and parse the response body as JSON using the .json() method. Finally, we access the response data in the second .then() block.

//POST: This method is used to send data to the server, typically to create a new resource. For example:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'John', age: 30 })
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

  //In this example, we make a POST request to the URL 'https://api.example.com/users'. We specify the request method as 'POST', set the 'Content-Type' header to 'application/json', and include the request body as a JSON string using JSON.stringify().

//Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the "PUT" method with the Fetch API:
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe', age: 35 })
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

  //In this example, we are making a "PUT" request to update an existing user with the ID "123" on the server. We provide the URL 'https://api.example.com/users/123' as the endpoint to indicate the specific user we want to update.

// The request includes the following details:

  //Method: We set the method to 'PUT' to indicate that we want to update the resource.
  // Headers: We include the 'Content-Type' header and set it to 'application/json' to specify that the request body is in JSON format.
  //Body: We use JSON.stringify() to convert an object { name: 'John Doe', age: 35 } into a JSON string and pass it as the request body.
  //Similar to the previous examples, we handle the response in the .then() block. If the response is successful (response.ok), we parse the response body as JSON. Finally, we access the response data and handle any errors in the .catch() block.


  //Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the "PATCH" method with the Fetch API:
  fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ age: 36 })
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

//In this example, we are making a "PATCH" request to partially update an existing user with the ID "123" on the server. We provide the URL 'https://api.example.com/users/123' as the endpoint to indicate the specific user we want to update.

//The request includes the following details:

//Method: We set the method to 'PATCH' to indicate that we want to partially update the resource.
//Headers: We include the 'Content-Type' header and set it to 'application/json' to specify that the request body is in JSON format.
//Body: We use JSON.stringify() to convert an object { age: 36 } into a JSON string and pass it as the request body. In this case, we are updating only the "age" property of the user.

//Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the "PATCH" method with the Fetch API:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ age: 36 })
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });


  //In this example, we are making a "PATCH" request to partially update an existing user with the ID "123" on the server. We provide the URL 'https://api.example.com/users/123' as the endpoint to indicate the specific user we want to update.


  //The request includes the following details:

  //Similar to previous examples, we handle the response in the .then() block. If the response is successful (response.ok), we parse the response body as JSON. Finally, we access the response data and handle any errors in the .catch() block.


  //The main difference between the "PATCH" and "PUT" methods lies in the intended use and semantics.

  //The "PATCH" method is used to partially update a resource on the server. It is typically employed when you want to modify specific attributes or fields of an existing resource while leaving the rest of the resource unchanged. In other words, it is used for making partial updates.

  //For example, if you have a user resource with properties like name, age, and email, and you want to update only the age of the user, you can use the "PATCH" method. The request body would contain only the updated attributes, such as { "age": 30 }, while the other properties remain unchanged.

//The "PUT" method, on the other hand, is used to completely replace a resource on the server. It is typically used when you want to update an entire resource, including all its attributes, by providing a complete representation of the updated resource.

//When making a "PUT" request, you generally send the entire updated resource in the request body. The server replaces the existing resource with the provided representation. If any properties are missing in the request body, they might be considered null or empty on the server-side.
// /For example, if you have a user resource with properties like name, age, and email, and you want to update all the properties of the user, you would use the "PUT" method. The request body would contain the complete updated representation of the user, such as { "name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "email": "john@example.com" }.


//In summary, the "PATCH" method is used for making partial updates to a resource, while the "PUT" method is used to completely replace a resource with a new representation. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific requirements and semantics of the API you are working with.

//Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the "DELETE" method with the Fetch API:
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('User deleted successfully.');
    } else {
      throw new Error('Network response was not OK.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
  //Similar to previous examples, we handle the response in the .then() block. If the response is successful (response.ok), we display a message indicating that the user was deleted successfully. Otherwise, we throw an error if the network response was not OK. Finally, we handle any errors in the .catch() block.

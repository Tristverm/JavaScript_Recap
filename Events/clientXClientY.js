//The clientX and clientY properties are properties of the event object in JavaScript, and they represent the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the viewport (i.e., the visible area of the web page) at the time when the event occurred.

//More specifically, clientX represents the X coordinate of the mouse pointer, and clientY represents the Y coordinate of the mouse pointer. These coordinates are measured in pixels, with (0,0) being the top-left corner of the viewport.

//Note that clientX and clientY are different from other mouse event properties such as pageX and pageY, which represent the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the entire web page (i.e., including any scrolling). In most cases, you will want to use clientX and clientY to determine the location of the mouse pointer within the viewport.

//Here's an example of how you might use clientX and clientY in a mouse event handler function:

document.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  console.log(
    "Mouse clicked at (" + event.clientX + ", " + event.clientY + ")"
  );
});

//This code adds a click event listener to the entire document, and when the user clicks anywhere on the page, it logs the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the viewport at the time of the click.

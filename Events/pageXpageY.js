//In JavaScript, the pageX and pageY properties are properties of the event object, and they represent the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the entire web page (including any scrolling) at the time when the event occurred.

//More specifically, pageX represents the X coordinate of the mouse pointer, and pageY represents the Y coordinate of the mouse pointer. These coordinates are measured in pixels, with (0,0) being the top-left corner of the entire web page (i.e., including any scrolling).


//Unlike the clientX and clientY properties, which are relative to the top-left corner of the viewport, pageX and pageY take into account any scrolling that has occurred on the page. This can be useful in cases where you need to determine the absolute position of an element on the page, regardless of its position within the viewport.


//Here's an example of how you might use pageX and pageY in a mouse event handler function:

document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('Mouse clicked at (' + event.pageX + ', ' + event.pageY + ')');
  });
  
//This code adds a click event listener to the entire document, and when the user clicks anywhere on the page, it logs the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the entire web page (including any scrolling) at the time of the click.

//Note that pageX and pageY are not supported in some older browsers (such as Internet Explorer), and in some cases you may need to use alternative properties or techniques to determine the position of the mouse pointer on the page.

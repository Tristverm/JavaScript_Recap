//In JavaScript, static fields are properties that are attached directly to a class itself, rather than to instances of the class. They are shared across all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name, without the need to create an instance. The purpose of static fields in classes is to store and access class-level data or behavior, as opposed to instance-specific data or behavior.

//Here is a highly detailed example to illustrate the use of static fields in classes in JavaScript:

class Car {
    static numOfCars = 0; // static field
  
    constructor(brand, model) {
      this.brand = brand;
      this.model = model;
      Car.numOfCars++; // increment the static field for each new instance
    }
  
    static getNumOfCars() { // static method
      return Car.numOfCars;
    }
  
    getBrand() { // instance method
      return this.brand;
    }
  
    getModel() { // instance method
      return this.model;
    }
  }
  
  const car1 = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
  const car2 = new Car('Honda', 'Civic');
  
  console.log(Car.getNumOfCars()); // output: 2
  console.log(car1.getBrand()); // output: 'Toyota'
  console.log(car2.getModel()); // output: 'Civic'
  
  //In this example, we define a Car class with a static field numOfCars that keeps track of the total number of cars created. The static field is incremented in the class constructor each time a new instance of Car is created. We also define a static method getNumOfCars() that returns the value of the numOfCars static field.


  //We create two instances of Car using the new keyword and access the static method getNumOfCars() and instance methods getBrand() and getModel() using the class name and instance names respectively.

// /As we can see from the output, the static field numOfCars is shared among all instances of the Car class, and the static method getNumOfCars() allows us to access this data without creating an instance. This makes it easier to manage and access class-level data or behavior.


//Overall, the purpose of static fields in classes in JavaScript is to store and access class-level data or behavior that is shared among all instances of the class. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as keeping track of the number of instances of a class, defining shared constants, or providing utility functions that do not depend on instance-specific data.




//example
// Storing configuration data: Static fields can be used to store configuration data that is shared across all instances of a class. For example, if you have a class that interacts with a web API, you might want to store the base URL for the API as a static field:


class ApiClient {
    static baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
  
    // ...
  }
  
  console.log(ApiClient.baseUrl); // 'https://api.example.com'

  
  
  //example

  //Implementing utility functions: Static fields can be used to define utility functions that are related to a class. For example, if you have a class that represents a date, you might want to define a static method that calculates the difference between two dates:

  class Date {
    static diffInDays(date1, date2) {
      const diff = Math.abs(date2 - date1);
      return Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
  
    constructor(year, month, day) {
      // ...
    }
  
    // ...
  }
  
  const date1 = new Date(2023, 3, 21);
  const date2 = new Date(2023, 4, 1);
  console.log(Date.diffInDays(date1, date2)); // 10
  


  //example
  //Keeping track of class state: Static fields can be used to keep track of state that is shared across all instances of a class. For example, if you have a class that represents a counter, you might want to keep track of the total number of instances that have been created:

  class Counter {
    static count = 0;
  
    constructor() {
      Counter.count++;
      this.value = 0;
    }
  
    increment() {
      this.value++;
    }
  }
  
  const counter1 = new Counter();
  const counter2 = new Counter();
  console.log(Counter.count); // 2
  
  //In this example, the count static field is incremented each time a new instance of the Counter class is created, and can be accessed directly on the class to get the total number of instances that have been created.

  //Overall, static fields in JavaScript provide a way to store data or behavior that is related to a class as a whole, rather than to any specific instance of the class. They can be used to store configuration data, define utility functions, or keep track of class state, among other things.



  //example
  class MathUtils {
    static PI = 3.14159;
  
    static calculateCircleArea(radius) {
      return MathUtils.PI * radius * radius;
    }
  
    static calculateCircleCircumference(radius) {
      return 2 * MathUtils.PI * radius;
    }
  }
  
  console.log(MathUtils.calculateCircleArea(5)); // Output: 78.53975
  console.log(MathUtils.calculateCircleCircumference(5)); // Output: 31.4159

  //In this example, the MathUtils class has a static field PI which is used to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. Since PI is a constant value, it makes sense to define it as a static field rather than as an instance property.
